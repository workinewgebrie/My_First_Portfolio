            <h2>Web Technology Overview</h2>
            <p>Web technology operates through a client-server model where browsers (clients) 
                send requests to web servers, which respond with web content using protocols like HTTP.
                 It relies on technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks to deliver dynamic, interactive experiences.
                  In the current market, web development is booming due to growing digital demand, with trends focusing
                   on progressive web apps, AI integration, and responsive design.</p>
