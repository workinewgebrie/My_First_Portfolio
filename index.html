            <h2>Web Technology Overview</h2>
            <p>Web technology operates through a client-server model where browsers (clients) 
                send requests to web servers, which respond with web content using protocols like HTTP.
                 It relies on technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks to deliver dynamic, interactive experiences.
                  In the current market, web development is booming due to growing digital demand, with trends focusing
                   on progressive web apps, AI integration, and responsive design.</p>

                    <h3> Frontend and Backend Technologies:</h3>
                    <p>
Web development is generally divided into frontend and backend development.
 Frontend refers to the parts of a website that users interact with directly, including layouts, buttons, and animations.
  Common frontend technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue.js. 
  On the other hand, backend development involves server-side operations such as managing databases, 
  handling authentication, and processing logic. 
Technologies like Node.js, Django, PHP, and databases 
like MySQL or MongoDB are commonly used for backend development.</p>

                    <h3> Web Servers and Protocols:</h3>
                    <p> 
Web servers are responsible for delivering web content to users by handling requests and sending responses.
 Popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft's IIS. 
 The communication between clients (like web browsers) and servers typically uses the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
  HTTPS is the secure version, using SSL/TLS encryption to protect data transfer. 
These protocols play a crucial role in ensuring data is transmitted correctly and securely across the internet.</p>

                    <h3>Trends in Modern Web Development:</h3>
                    <p>
Modern web development is evolving rapidly with trends such as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), Single Page Applications (SPAs), and serverless architectures. 
Developers are also using tools like GitHub for version control, Docker for containerization, and CI/CD pipelines for automation. 
Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence and APIs has led to more dynamic and personalized web experiences. 
Staying updated with these trends is important for developers to create fast, secure, and user-friendly websites
